//* Maps
/*

?        Map objects are collections of key-value pairs. A key in the Map may only occur once; it is unique in the Map's collection.
?        A Map does not contain any keys by default. It only contains what is explicitly put into it.	
?        Objects vs. Maps
?        Object is similar to Mapâ€”both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. 
?        A Map's keys can be any value (including functions, objects, or any primitive).	
?        The keys of an Object must be either a String or a Symbol.
?        The number of items in a Map is easily retrieved from its size property.	
?        Determining the number of items in an Object is more roundabout and less efficient. A common way to do it is through the length of the array returned from Object.keys().
